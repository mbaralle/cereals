The configuration file contains the usual configuration parameters for Play and Akka, plus the ADR module specific configuration :

```

    // This value must be increased according to the number of cameras in the system, as we need cache for every camera,
    // camera-group, etc. So to avoid any issue, we allow up to 10 000 elements in the query-cache
    cache.maximum-size = 10000
  }

    # Minimum similitude to accept a vehicle as match. This only applies if we do not have any match with the
    # mapping key (default match is 100% similitude for the same mapping key).

    minimum-similitude = 90

    camera.max-recovery-duration = 7 days

    buffer = {

      database-cache-duration = 5 minutes # How much time we can keep track of the buffer info from the db. Not an issue to have a big value
    }

    groups = {

      # Important: If the following is not set, we use the default m3.matching_expiration_ms.

    }
  }
}
